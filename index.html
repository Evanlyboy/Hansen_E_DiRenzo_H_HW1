<h1 class="Evan">Evan's Bio</h1>
<p>
Heya, my name is Evan and I'm 21 from Guelph, Ontario. I'm in IDP because I have a passion for creating. My career goal is to become a creative director, and I found this to be an excellent stepping stone to that end. I have a background in a few different interesting departments but I'm primarily formally educated in communication technologies. I'm familiar with everything we're learning so far other than HTML, so I have a strong understanding of what's going on. 
<br><br>
If you were to get to know me you'd find I have a broad range of skills and abilities which all center around learning how to make an idea I think is awesome a reality. Some of my hobbies include gaming/following the gaming industry, creating art and media, building desktops, researching things I'm interested in, and collecting TV shows, movies, and anime on a locally hosted server! I consider myself a fast learner and nothing excites me more than a cool idea in action. In regards to Smash I like to play heavier characters with a lot of weight behind their attacks.

	<h1>Evan's Mains</h1>
	<!-- Character 1 -->
	<h2>#1 Ike | Fire Emblem</h2>
	<p>
		Ike is a heavy damaging sword wielder with a diverse and interesting kit.
		<br><br>
		He does a lot of damage up close with his sword attacks while simultaneously being able to move around quickly with his sideways special. My favourite part of Ike is his ability to deflect attacks with his downward special and punish his opponent who make a foolish decision, something that never fails to make me happy. A good Ike player takes his time with his opponent and only strikes when he can make an effective move due to his slow speed. I really enjoy the "strike only when ready" aspect of Ike's character. I've actually never played the game he's from before though.

<!-- Character 2 -->
	<h2>#2 Bowser | Super Mario</h2>
	<p>
		Bowser is a heavy brawler type with an emphasis on zone of control. 
		<br><br>
		His main attacks are simple street fighting moves like punching and drop kicking, but he uses his size, brawn, and fire breathing effectively to deal lots of damage to his opponents. His large size makes him a big target for ranged fighters, but it also makes it hard to dodge his far-reaching attacks if you're right next to him. My favourite part about playing Bowser is his ability to grab someone and body slam them into the ground which is hard to pull off but can easily be a finishing blow. Essentially Bowser is all being a selfish asshole who takes up a lot of space and can easily deliver a deathblow or at least deal great amounts of damage if you're within his range. Great choice if I want to piss someone off.

<!-- Character 3 -->
	<h2>#3 King Dedede | Kirby</h2>
	<p>
		King Dedede is a heavy brawler type like Bowser except he has a more diverse kit like Ike.
		<br><br>
		His main attacks include whacking his opponents with his hammer and using his size to take space the same as Bowser. Dedede has a unique ability of being able to inhale projectiles and other players and spit them back out to cause damage and cause chaos. He can also pitch a spike as a ranged attack which is good for easy damage. Honestly for me, using King Dedede's hammer is my favourite part about his character because it's just so much fun to whack people with it.
